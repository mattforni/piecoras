these files are meant to represent the piecoras menu in the absence of a DB.
since the menu will not be updated very frequently and menu / orders would 
constitute the majority of the DB, it seems silly to add a DB dependency.

*PLEASE NOTE*
it is important to note that all fields no field may contain the ':' character
unless wrapped in quotation marks as this causes yaml parsing errors
